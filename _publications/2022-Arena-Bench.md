title: "Mapping of soil suitability for medicinal plants using machine learning methods"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-Arena-Bench
excrept: 'This study highlights the urgency of conserving medicinal plants amidst challenges like climate change and habitat loss. It proposes leveraging machine learning algorithms and geographic information systems (GIS) to swiftly identify regions suitable for nurturing vulnerable medicinal plants. By analyzing soil data and GIS information, machine learning techniques predict optimal growth conditions, aiding in the selection of suitable herbs. The research emphasizes the effectiveness of the extra tree classifier (EXTC), achieving remarkable accuracy rates of 99.01% for soil classification and 98.76% for subregion classification. Ultimately, this approach offers a rapid and comprehensive tool for stakeholders, including researchers and conservationists, to make informed decisions for conserving medicinal plants based on soil characteristics and regional suitability, visualized through interactive maps.'
