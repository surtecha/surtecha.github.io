title: "An Early Recommendation Tool to Enhance Medicinal Plant Growth based on GIS and Soil Data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-IEEE
excrept: 'Ayurvedic medicinal plants are gaining prominence for their efficacy and affordability compared to synthetic medicines. Recognizing the importance of conserving these plants, especially in regions like Karnataka, India, this study proposes a novel approach using the random forest algorithm to identify suitable soil types and geographical locations for key medicinal plants. By leveraging soil and GIS data, the system offers real-time recommendations for growing and conserving these plants. The decision tree-based model provides essential details such as conservation status, soil type, region name, geo-location, and climate conditions, aiding stakeholders in preserving traditional medicinal knowledge. Ultimately, this system serves as a valuable tool to promote the cultivation and conservation of Ayurvedic herbs while preserving ancient medicinal wisdom.'
