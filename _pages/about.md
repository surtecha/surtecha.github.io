👨🏻‍💻 I'm a penultimate year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science.

🔬 Pursuing academic interdisciplinary research at the intersection of machine learning.

📚 My interests include deep learning, computer vision, automation, robotics and geospatial data analysis.

💻 I'm currently working on [Multi-Physics Simulation Engine](https://github.com/surtecha/multi-physics-simulation-engine) and [karman](https://github.com/surtecha/karman)

# Selected Experience

## 📜 Research
As a **Student Researcher**, I have gained significant experience in academic research, including the development of a novel method for identifying optimal growth locations for endangered medicinal herbs. 

This work received recognition, earning me an invitation to present at the prestigious **IC2E3-2023** international conference hosted by the National Institute of Technology, Uttarakhand, India. 

Building on this initiative, I led a long-term research project that resulted in a publication in **Scientific Reports** of the **Nature Portfolio**.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
In my role as an **App Development Intern** at a respected multispecialty hospital in South India, I undertook a pivotal capstone project. This project centered on crafting a **cross-platform mobile application** tailored for the remote monitoring of ICU patients. Through this experience, I honed my skills in app development while contributing to impactful healthcare technology solutions.

## 📚 Technical Workshops
As a co-founder of the Competitive Programming Club and a core member of the Ethical Hacking Club at my institute, I played a key role in organizing and hosting technical workshops. Through these responsibilities, I facilitated collaborative learning environments and fostered a sense of community among fellow students and juniors interested in coding and cybersecurity.
